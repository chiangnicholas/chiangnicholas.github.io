## About Me

Hi! I'm an Economics PhD student, and my interests are in Labour and Public Economics. 

Before this role, I was an Economist at Singapore's [Ministry of Trade and Industry](https://www.mti.gov.sg/), and [Ministry of Social and Family Development](https://www.msf.gov.sg/). 

On this webpage, I post thoughts on existing and past projects I am working on.
